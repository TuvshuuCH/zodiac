                    <p class="right-paragraph">Astronomy is a natural science that studies celestial objects and
                        phenomena. It uses mathematics, physics, and chemistry in order to explain their origin and
                        evolution. Objects of interest include planets, moons, stars, nebulae, galaxies,
                        meteoroid, asteroid, and comets. Relevant phenomena include supernova explosions,
                        gamma ray bursts, quasars, blazars, pulsars, and cosmic microwave background radiation.
                        More generally, astronomy studies everything that originates beyond Earth's atmosphere.
